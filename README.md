# Excel to Notepad
Small program which splits an excel file into a space delimited file that is human-readable even in default notepad applications

# Usage:
Clone the repo and put the excel files which you want to convert into the repo folder as the script and run the script using
`python main.py`
The files will be converted and placed in the same directory and will retain the same name (with the extension changed to .txt)
